 <h2>Conditional logistic regression </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Estimates a logistic regression model by maximising the conditional
 likelihood. Uses a model formula of the form
 <code>case.status~exposure+strata(matched.set)</code>.
 The default is to use the exact conditional likelihood, a commonly
 used approximate conditional likelihood is provided for compatibility
 with older software.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 clogit(formula, data, weights, subset, na.action,
  method=c("exact", "approximate", "efron", "breslow"),
  ...)
 </pre>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>A stratified Cox model with time=constant, status of 1=case 0=control,
 and using the exact partial likelihood has the same likelihood formula
 as a conditional logistic regression.  The clogit routine creates
 the necessary dummy variable of times (all 1) and then calls coxph.
 </p>
 <p>The computation of the exact partial likelihood can be very slow,
 however.  If a particular strata had say 10 events out of 20 subjects
 we have to add up a denominator that involves all possible ways of
 choosing 10 out of 20, which is 20!/(10! 10!) = 184756 terms. Gail et
 al describe a fast recursion method, which largely ameleorates 
 this; 
 it was incorporated into version 2.36-11 of the survival package.
 (Most of the time conditional logistic modeling 
 is applied data with 1 case + k controls per set, however, 
 which involves choosing 1 out of k and the computational issue
 above does not arise.)
 The 'appoximate' option maps to the
 Breslow approximation for historical reasons.
 </p>
 <p>It is not clear how case weights should be handled.  For instance if
 there are two deaths in a strata, one with weight=1 and one with
 weight=2, should the likelihood calculation consider all subsets of
 size 2 or all subsets of size 3?
 Consequently, case weights are ignored by the routine.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>"clogit"</code>, which is a wrapper for a
 <code>"coxph"</code> object.
