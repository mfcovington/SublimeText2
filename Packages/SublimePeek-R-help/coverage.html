 <h2>Coverage across a set of ranges</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Counts the number of times a position is represented in a set of ranges. 
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 coverage(x, shift=0L, width=NULL, weight=1L, ...)
 ## S4 method for signature 'RangesList'
 coverage(x,
        shift = structure(rep(list(0L), length(x)), names = names(x)),
        width = structure(rep(list(NULL), length(x)), names = names(x)),
        weight = structure(rep(list(1L), length(x)), names = names(x)),
        method = c("sort", "hash"))
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>An IRanges, Views, MaskCollection, 
 RangesList, RangedData object, or any object for which a
 <code>coverage</code> method is defined.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>shift</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>For most methods, an integer vector (recycled to the length of
 <code>x</code>) specifying how each element in <code>x</code> should be
 (horizontally) shifted before the coverage is computed. Only shifted
 indices in the range [1, <code>width</code>] will be included in the coverage
 calculation.
 For RangesList and RangedData objects, a list or vector
 of the same length as <code>x</code> to be used for the corresponding element
 in <code>x</code>. In addition for RangedData objects, can also be
 a character vector of length 1 denoting the column to use in
 <code>values(x)</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>For most methods, the length of the returned coverage vector. For
 RangesList and RangedData objects, a list or vector of
 the same length as <code>x</code> to be used for the corresponding element
 in <code>x</code>. In addition for RangedData objects, can also be
 a character vector of length 1 denoting the column to use in
 <code>values(x)</code>.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>width=NULL</code> (the default), then the specific <code>coverage</code>
 method that is actually selected will choose the length of the returned
 vector &quot;in a way that makes sense&quot;.
 </p>
 <p>For example, when <code>width=NULL</code>, the method for IRanges objects
 returns a vector that has just enough elements to have its last
 element aligned with the rightmost end of all the ranges in <code>x</code> after
 those ranges have been shifted (see the <code>shift</code> argument above).
 This ensures that any longer coverage vector would be a &quot;padded with zeros&quot;
 version of the vector returned when <code>width=NULL</code>.
 </p>
 <p>When <code>width=NULL</code>, the method for Views objects
 returns a vector with <code>length(subject(x))</code> elements.
 </p>
 <p>When <code>width=NULL</code>, the method for MaskCollection objects
 returns a vector with <code>width(x)</code> elements.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>weight</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>For most methods, an integer vector specifying how much each element
 in <code>x</code> counts. For RangesList and RangedData
 objects, a list or vector of the same length as <code>x</code> to be used
 for the corresponding element in <code>x</code>.
 For IRanges, Views, MaskCollection and
 RangedData objects, this can also be a single string naming
 a column in <code>elementMetadata(x)</code> (or in <code>x</code> for
 RangedData) to be used as the weights.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Settings <code>method</code> to <code>hash</code> is intended only for large
 <code>x</code> objects. If <code>method</code> is set to the <code>sort</code>
 default, then <code>x</code> is sorted during the calculation of the
 coverage Rle. If <code>method</code> is set to <code>hash</code>, then
 <code>x</code> is hashed to a vector of size <code>width</code>. Note that
 setting <code>method</code> to <code>hash</code> saves time on large <code>x</code>
 vectors, but at the expense of additional memory usage.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>

 <p>Further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.

 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>For most methods, an Rle object representing the coverage of
 <code>x</code>. For RangesList and RangedData objects, a
 SimpleRleList object representing a list of coverage vectors.
 </p>
 <p>An integer value called the &quot;coverage&quot; can be associated to each position
 in <code>x</code>, indicating how many times this position is covered by the
 elements contained in <code>x</code>.
 For example, if <code>x</code> is a Views object, the coverage of
 a given position in <code>subject(x)</code> is the number of views it belongs to.
