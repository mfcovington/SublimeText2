 Get the 'devel' version of the BiocInstaller package.
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Downloads the 'devel' version of the BiocInstaller package
 so that all subsequent invocations of <code>biocLite</code>
 and <code>biocinstallRepos</code> use the devel repositories.
 </p>
 <p>Displays the URLs of the repositories used by <code>biocLite</code>
 to install Bioconductor and CRAN packages.
 </p>
 <p>Should only be used with a release (or patched) version of R,
 freshly installed.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 useDevel(devel=TRUE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>devel</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Whether to look in the devel (TRUE) or release
 (FALSE) repositories in subsequent invocations of
 <code>biocLite</code> and <code>biocinstallRepos</code>.</p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>With R going to a yearly release schedule and Bioconductor keeping its
 twice-yearly release schedule, the same version of R (2.15) can be used
 with two different versions of Bioconductor (2.10, release, and 2.11, devel).
 The version number of the BiocInstaller package is what is used to determine
 whether to download packages from the BioC 2.10 or 2.11 repositories.
 In keeping with Bioconductor versioning conventions, if the middle number
 (y in x.y.z) is even, the package is part of a release version; if odd, it's
 part of a devel version.
 </p>
 <p>By default, when BiocInstaller is first installed on R-2.15, it will be
 set up to download BioC 2.10 packages. 
 </p>
 <p>If you want to change this, you can run the <code>useDevel</code>
 function. With argument <code>TRUE</code> (the default), it will download
 the devel version of BiocInstaller and subsequently all packages
 downloaded with <code>biocLite</code> will be from the BioC 2.11
 (devel) repository. You should run <code>useDevel</code> only once.
 </p>
 <p>It is possible to keep BioC 2.10 and 2.11 libraries separate, within
 the same installation of R.
 </p>
 <p>The trick is to use the <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> environment variable.
 First, create two separate directories for your BioC release
 and devel packages. Suggested directory names are as follows:
 </p>
 <p>Linux:
 </p>
 <p>~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-release
 </p>
 <p>~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-devel
 </p>
 <p>Mac OS:
 </p>
 <p>~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-release/library
 </p>
 <p>~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-devel/library
 </p>
 <p>Windows:
 </p>
 <p>C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\R\win-library\2.15-bioc-release
 </p>
 <p>C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\R\win-library\2.15-bioc-devel
 </p>
 <p>(change YOUR_USER_NAME to your user name)
 </p>
 <p>You can then invoke &quot;R for bioc-devel&quot; or &quot;R for bioc-release&quot; from
 the command line as follows:
 </p>
 <p>Linux:
 </p>
 <p>R_LIBS_USER=~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-release R
 </p>
 <p>R_LIBS_USER=~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-devel R
 </p>
 <p>Mac OS X:
 </p>
 <p>R_LIBS_USER=~~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-release/library R
 R_LIBS_USER=~~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-devel/library R
 </p>
 <p>Windows:
 </p>
 <p>cmd /C &quot;set R_LIBS_USER=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\R\win-library\2.15-bioc-release &amp;&amp;  R&quot;
 </p>
 <p>cmd /C &quot;set R_LIBS_USER=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\R\win-library\2.15-bioc-devel &amp;&amp;  R&quot;
 </p>
 <p>(Note: this assumes that R.exe is in your PATH.)
 </p>
 <p>If you launch R in this way and then invoke <code>.libPaths</code>,
 you'll see that the first item is your special release or
 devel directory. Packages will be installed to that directory and that
 is the first place that <code>library</code> will look for them. 
 <code>biocLite</code>, <code>install.packages</code>,
 <code>update.packages</code> and friends all respect this
 setting.
 </p>
 <p>On Linux and Mac OS X, you can create a bash alias to save typing. Add the
 following to your ~/bash_profile:
 </p>
 <p>Linux
 </p>
 <p>alias Rdevel='R_LIBS_USER=~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-devel R'
 </p>
 <p>alias Rrelease='R_LIBS_USER=~/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/2.15-bioc-release R'
 </p>
 <p>Mac OS X
 </p>
 <p>alias Rdevel='R_LIBS_USER=~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-devel/library R'
 alias Rrelease='R_LIBS_USER=~/Library/R/2.15-bioc-release/library R'
 </p>
 <p>You can then invoke these from the command line as
 </p>
 <p>Rdevel
 </p>
 <p>...and...
 </p>
 <p>Rrelease
 </p>
 <p>On Windows, you can create two shortcuts, one for devel and one for
 release. Go to My Computer and navigate to a directory that is in your
 PATH. Then right-click and choose New-&gt;Shortcut.
 </p>
 <p>in the &quot;type the location of the item&quot; box, put:
 </p>
 <p>cmd /C &quot;set R_LIBS_USER=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\R\win-library\2.15-bioc-release &amp;&amp;  R&quot;
 </p>
 <p>...for release and
 </p>
 <p>cmd /C &quot;set R_LIBS_USER=C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>\win-library\2.15-bioc-devel &amp;&amp;  R&quot;
 </p>
 <p>...for devel.
 </p>
 <p>(again, it's assumed R.exe is in your PATH)
 </p>
 <p>Click &quot;Next&quot;.
 </p>
 <p>In the &quot;Type a name for this shortcut&quot; box, type
 </p>
 <p>Rdevel
 </p>
 <p>or
 </p>
 <p>Rrelease
 </p>
 <p>You can invoke these from the command line as
 </p>
 <p>Rdevel.lnk
 </p>
 <p>...and...
 </p>
 <p>Rrelease.lnk
 </p>
 <p>(You must type in the .lnk extension.)
 </p>
 <p>Because <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> is an environment variable, its value should be
 inherited by any subprocesses started by R, so they should do the
 right thing as well.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>Invisible NULL.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>See Also</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>biocinstallRepos</code> returns the Bioconductor and CRAN
 repositories used by <code>biocLite</code>.
 </p>
 <p><code>biocLite</code> Installs/updates Bioconductor/CRAN packages.
 </p>
 <p><code>install.packages</code> installs the packages themselves.
 </p>
 <p><code>chooseBioCmirror</code> lets you choose from a list of all
 public Bioconductor mirror URLs.
 </p>
 <p><code>chooseCRANmirror</code> lets you choose from a list of all
 public CRAN mirror URLs.
