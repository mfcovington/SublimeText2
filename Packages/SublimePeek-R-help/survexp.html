 <h2>
 Compute Expected Survival 
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Returns either the expected survival of a cohort of subjects, or the 
 individual expected survival for each subject. 
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 survexp(formula, data, weights, subset, na.action, rmap, times, cohort=TRUE, 
         conditional=FALSE, ratetable=survexp.us, scale=1, npoints, 
         se.fit, model=FALSE, x=FALSE, y=FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>formula object.  The response variable is a vector of follow-up times 
 and is optional.  The predictors consist of optional grouping variables 
 separated by the <code>+</code> operator (as in <code>survfit</code>), and is often
 <code>~1</code>, i.e., expected survival for the entire group.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>data frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
 the <code>formula</code>, <code>subset</code> and <code>weights</code> arguments. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>case weights. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>expression indicating a subset of the rows of <code>data</code> to be used in the fit. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>function to filter missing data. This is applied to the model frame after  
 <code>subset</code> has been applied.  Default is <code>options()$na.action</code>. A possible 
 value for <code>na.action</code> is <code>na.omit</code>, which deletes observations that contain 
 one or more missing values. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>rmap</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>an optional list that maps data set names to the ratetable names.  See
 the details section below.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>times</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>vector of follow-up times at which the resulting survival curve is  
 evaluated.  If absent, the result will be reported for each unique  
 value of the vector of follow-up times supplied in <code>formula</code>. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>cohort</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>logical value: if <code>FALSE</code>, each subject is treated as a subgroup of size 1. 
 The default is <code>TRUE</code>. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>conditional</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>logical value: if <code>TRUE</code>, the follow-up times supplied in <code>formula</code> 
 are death times and conditional expected survival is computed. 
 If <code>FALSE</code>, the follow-up times are potential censoring times.  
 If follow-up times are missing in <code>formula</code>, this argument is ignored.   
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>ratetable</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>a table of event rates, such as <code>survexp.uswhite</code>, or a fitted Cox model. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>scale</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>numeric value to scale the results.  If <code>ratetable</code> is in units/day, 
 <code>scale = 365.25</code> causes the output to be reported in years. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>npoints</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>number of points at which to calculate intermediate results, evenly spaced  
 over the range of the follow-up times.  The usual (exact) calculation is done  
 at each unique follow-up time. For very large data sets specifying <code>npoints</code>  
 can reduce the amount of memory and computation required. 
 For a prediction from a Cox model <code>npoints</code> is ignored. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>se.fit</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>compute the standard error of the predicted survival.  
 The default is to compute standard errors whenever  
 possible, which at this time is only for the Ederer method and a Cox  
 model as the rate table. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>model,x,y</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>flags to control what is returned.  If any of these is true, then the
 model frame, the model matrix, and/or the vector of response times will be
 returned as components of the final result, with the same names as the
 flag arguments.
 </p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Individual expected survival is usually used in models or testing, to 
 &lsquo;correct&rsquo; for the age and sex composition of a group of subjects. 
 For instance, assume that birth date, entry date into the study, 
 sex and actual survival time are all known for a group of subjects. 
 The <code>survexp.us</code> population tables contain expected death rates 
 based on calendar year, sex and age. 
 Then 
 </p>
 <PRE>
   haz &lt;- -log(survexp(fu.time ~ 1, data=mydata, 
                       rmap = list(year=entry.dt, age=(birth.dt-entry.dt)),
                       cohort=FALSE)) 
 </PRE>
 gives for each subject the total hazard experienced up to their observed 
 death time or last follow-up time (variable fu.time) 
 This probability can be used as a rescaled time value in models: 
 <PRE>
 glm(status ~ 1 + offset(log(haz)), family=poisson) 
 glm(status ~ x + offset(log(haz)), family=poisson) 
 </PRE>
 In the first model, a test for intercept=0 is the one sample log-rank 
 test of whether the observed group of subjects has equivalent survival to 
 the baseline population.  The second model tests for an effect of variable 
 <code>x</code> after adjustment for age and sex. 
 The ratetable being used may have different variable names than the user's
 data set, this is dealt with by the <code>rmap</code> argument.  
 The rate table for the above calculation was <code>survexp.us</code>, a call to
 <code>summary{survexp.us}</code> reveals that it expects to have variables 
 <code>age</code> = age in days, <code>sex</code>, and <code>year</code> = the date of study
 entry, we create them in the <code>rmap</code> line.  The sex variable is not
 mapped, therefore the code assumes that it exists in <code>mydata</code> in the
 correct format.  (Note: for factors such as sex, the program will match on
 any unique abbreviation, ignoring case.)
 Cohort survival is used to produce an overall survival curve.  This is then 
 added to the Kaplan-Meier plot of the study group for visual comparison 
 between these subjects and the population at large.  There are three common 
 methods of computing cohort survival. 
 In the &quot;exact method&quot; of Ederer the cohort is not censored; this corresponds 
 to having no response variable in the formula.  Hakulinen recommends censoring 
 the cohort at the anticipated censoring time of each patient, and Verheul 
 recommends censoring the cohort at the actual observation time of each 
 patient. 
 The last of these is the conditional method. 
 These are obtained by using the respective time values as the 
 follow-up time or response in the formula. 
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>if <code>cohort=TRUE</code> an object of class <code>survexp</code>, 
 otherwise a vector of per-subject expected survival values. 
 The former contains the number of subjects at risk 
 and the expected survival for the cohort at each requested time.
