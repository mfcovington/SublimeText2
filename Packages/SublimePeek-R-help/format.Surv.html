 <h2>
 Create a Survival Object 
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Create a survival object, usually used as a response variable in a model 
 formula. Argument matching is special for this function, see Details below.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 Surv(time, time2, event,
     type=c('right', 'left', 'interval', 'counting', 'interval2'),
     origin=0)
 is.Surv(x)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>time</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>for right censored data, this is the follow up time.  For interval
 data, the first argument is the starting time for the interval. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>event</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.  Other choices are
 <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> (<code>TRUE</code> = death) or 1/2 (2=death). For
 interval censored data, the status indicator is 0=right censored,
 1=event at <code>time</code>, 2=left censored, 3=interval censored.
 Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
 all subjects are assumed to have an event.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>time2</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>ending time of the interval for interval censored  or counting
 process data only.  Intervals are assumed to be open on the left and
 closed on the right, <code>(start, end]</code>.  For counting process
 data, <code>event</code> indicates whether an event occurred at the end of
 the interval.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>character string specifying the type of censoring. Possible values
 are <code>"right"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, <code>"counting"</code>,
 <code>"interval"</code>, or <code>"interval2"</code>.  The default is
 <code>"right"</code> or <code>"counting"</code> depending on whether the
 <code>time2</code> argument is absent or present, respectively.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>for counting process data, the hazard function origin.  This option
 was intended to be used in conjunction with a model containing
 time dependent
 strata in order to align the subjects properly when they cross over
 from one strata to another, but it has rarely proven useful.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>any R object.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Typical usages are
 </p>
 <PRE>
 Surv(time, event)
 Surv(time, time2, event, type= )
 </PRE>
 The <code>time</code>,<code>time2</code> and <code>event</code> arguments are matched by
 position, not by name, so use, eg, <code>Surv(time, dead)</code> rather than
 <code>Surv(time, event=dead)</code>
 In theory it is possible to represent interval censored data without a 
 third column containing the explicit status.  Exact, right censored, 
 left censored and interval censored observation would be represented as 
 intervals of [a,a], (a, infinity), (-infinity,b), and [a,b]  
 respectively; each interval is a pair of time points 
 within which the event is  
 known to have occurred. 
 If <code>type="interval2"</code> then the representation given above is 
 assumed, with <code>NA</code> taking the place of infinity.  
 If <code>type="interval"</code> then <code>event</code> must be given.  
 If <code>event</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>, 
 the relevant 
 information is assumed to be contained in <code>time</code>,
 the value in <code>time2</code> is ignored,
 and the second column of the internal representation contains a 
 placeholder value.
 Presently, the only methods allowing interval censored data are the 
 parametric models computed by <code>survreg</code> and survival curves
 computed by <code>survfit</code>; for both of these, 
 the distinction between open and closed intervals
 is unimportant.  
 The distinction is important for counting process data and 
 the Cox model. 
 The function tries to distinguish between the use of 0/1 and 1/2 coding for 
 left and right censored data using 
 <code>if (max(status)==2)</code>. 
 If 1/2 coding is used and all the subjects are censored, it will 
 guess wrong.
 In any questionable case it is safer to use logical coding,
 e.g., <code>Surv(time, status==3)</code> would indicate that a <code>3</code> is
 the code for an event.
 Surv objects can be subscripted either as an object, e.g.
 <code>x[1:3]</code> using a single subscript;
 in which case the <code>drop</code> argument is ignored;
 or as a matrix, using two arguments.
 If the second subscript is missing and <code>drop=F</code>
 (the default),
 the result of the subscripting will be a Surv object, e.g., 
 <code>x[1:3,,drop=F]</code>,
 otherwise the result will be a matrix (or vector), in accordance with
 the default behavior for subscripting matrices. 
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>Surv</code>.  There are methods for <code>print</code>,
 <code>is.na</code>, and subscripting survival objects.   <code>Surv</code> objects
 are implemented as a matrix of 2 or 3 columns.
 </p>
 <p>In the case of <code>is.Surv</code>, a logical value <code>TRUE</code> if <code>x</code>
 inherits from class <code>"Surv"</code>, otherwise an <code>FALSE</code>.
