 <h2>Interval Search Trees</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Efficiently perform overlap queries with an interval tree.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>A common type of query that arises when working with intervals is
 finding which intervals in one set overlap those in another. An
 efficient family of algorithms for answering such queries is known as
 the Interval Tree. This implementation makes use of the augmented tree
 algorithm from the reference below, but heavily adapts it for the use
 case of large, sorted query sets.
 </p>
 <p>The simplest approach is to call the <code>findOverlaps</code> function on a
 <code>Ranges</code> or other object with range information, as described in
 the following section.
 </p>
 <p>An <code>IntervalTree</code> object is a derivative of
 <code>Ranges</code> and stores its ranges as a tree that is
 optimized for overlap queries. Thus, for repeated queries against the
 same subject, it is more efficient to create an <code>IntervalTree</code>
 once for the subject using the constructor described below and then
 perform the queries against the <code>IntervalTree</code> instance.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Finding Overlaps</h3>
 
 
 <p>This main purpose of the interval tree is to optimize the search for
 ranges overlapping those in a query set. The interface for this
 operation is the <code>findOverlaps</code> function.
 </p>
 
 <dl>
 <dt></dt><dd>
 <p><code>findOverlaps(query, subject = query, maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L,
         type = c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"),
         select = c("all", "first", "last", "arbitrary"),
         drop = FALSE, ignoreSelf = FALSE, ignoreRedundant = FALSE)</code>:
 </p>
 <p>Find the intervals in <code>query</code>, a <code>Ranges</code>,
 <code>RangesList</code>, <code>RangedData</code>, or <code>integer</code> vector (to
 be converted to length-one ranges), that overlap with the
 intervals <code>subject</code>, a <code>Ranges</code>, <code>RangesList</code>, or
 <code>RangedData</code>. If <code>query</code> is unsorted, it is sorted
 first, so it is usually better to sort up-front, to avoid a sort
 with each <code>findOverlaps</code> call.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>subject</code> is omitted, <code>query</code> is queried against
 itself. In this case, and only this case, the <code>ignoreSelf</code>
 and <code>ignoreRedundant</code> arguments are allowed. By default,
 the result will contain hits for each range against itself, and if
 there is a hit from A to B, there is also a hit for B to A. If
 <code>ignoreSelf</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, all self matches are dropped. If
 <code>ignoreRedundant</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, only one of A-&gt;B and B-&gt;A
 is returned.
 </p>
 <p>Intervals with a separation of <code>maxgap</code> or less and a minimum
 of <code>minoverlap</code> overlapping positions, allowing for
 <code>maxgap</code>, are considered to be overlapping.  <code>maxgap</code>
 should be a scalar, non-negative, integer. <code>minoverlap</code>
 should be a scalar, positive integer.
 </p>
 <p>When <code>select</code> is &quot;all&quot;, the results are returned as a
 <code>Hits</code> object. When <code>select</code>
 is <code>"first"</code>, <code>"last"</code>, or <code>"arbitrary"</code> the results
 are returned as an integer vector of length <code>query</code> containing
 the first, last, or arbitrary overlapping interval in <code>subject</code>,
 with <code>NA</code> indicating intervals that did not overlap any intervals
 in <code>subject</code>.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>query</code> is a <code>RangesList</code> or
 <code>RangedData</code>, <code>subject</code> must be a
 <code>RangesList</code> or <code>RangedData</code>.  If both lists have names,
 each element from the subject is paired with the element from the
 query with the matching name, if any. Otherwise, elements are
 paired by position. The overlap is then computed between the pairs
 as described above. If <code>select</code> is <code>"all"</code>, a
 <code>Hits</code> is returned. For all other
 <code>select</code> the return value depends on the <code>drop</code> argument.
 When <code>select != "all" &amp;&amp; !drop</code>, an <code>IntegerList</code>
 is returned, where each element of the result corresponds to a space in
 <code>query</code>. When<code>select != "all" &amp;&amp; drop</code>, an integer vector is
 returned containing indices that are offset to align with the unlisted
 <code>query</code>.
 </p>
 <p>By default, any overlap is accepted. By specifying the <code>type</code>
 parameter, one can select for specific types of overlap. The types
 correspond to operations in Allen's Interval Algebra (see
 references). If <code>type</code> is <code>start</code> or <code>end</code>, the
 intervals are required to have matching starts or ends,
 respectively. While this operation seems trivial, the naive
 implementation using <code>outer</code> would be much less
 efficient. Specifying <code>equal</code> as the type returns the
 intersection of the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> matches. If
 <code>type</code> is <code>within</code>, the query interval must be wholly
 contained within the subject interval. Note that all matches must
 additionally satisfy the <code>minoverlap</code> constraint described above.
 </p>
 <p>The <code>maxgap</code> parameter has special meaning with the special
 overlap types. For <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>equal</code>,
 it specifies the maximum difference in the starts, ends or both,
 respectively. For <code>within</code>, it is the maximum amount by which
 the query may be wider than the subject.

 <p><code>countOverlaps(query, subject, maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L,
         type = c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"))</code>:
 Returns the overlap hit count for each range in <code>query</code> using the
 specified <code>findOverlaps</code> parameters. Both <code>query</code> and
 <code>subject</code> should be <code>Ranges</code>, <code>RangesList</code> or
 <code>RangedData</code> objects.
 </p>

 <p><code>subsetByOverlaps(query, subject, maxgap = 0L, minoverlap = 1L,
         type = c("any", "start", "end", "within", "equal"))</code>:
 Returns the subset of <code>query</code> that has an overlap hit with a range
 in <code>subject</code> using the specified <code>findOverlaps</code> parameters.
 Both <code>query</code> and <code>subject</code> should be <code>Ranges</code>,
 <code>RangesList</code> or <code>RangedData</code> objects.
 </p>
 </dd>
 <dt></dt><dd>
 <p><code>x %in% table</code>:
 Shortcut for finding the ranges in <code>x</code> that overlap any of
 the ranges in <code>table</code>. Both <code>x</code> and <code>table</code> should
 be <code>Ranges</code>, <code>RangesList</code> or <code>RangedData</code>
 objects. For <code>Ranges</code> objects, the result is a <code>logical</code>
 vector of length equal to the number of ranges in <code>x</code>. For
 <code>RangesList</code> and <code>RangedData</code> objects, the result is a
 <code>LogicalList</code> object, where each element of the
 result corresponds to a space in <code>x</code>.
 </p>
 </dd>
 <dt></dt><dd>
 <p><code>match(x, table, nomatch = NA_integer_, incomparables =
         NULL)</code>:
 Returns an integer vector of length <code>length(x)</code>, containing
 the index of the first overlapping range in <code>table</code> for each
 range in <code>x</code>. If a range in <code>x</code> does not overlap any
 ranges in <code>table</code>, its value is <code>nomatch</code>. The <code>x</code>
 and <code>table</code> arguments should either be both <code>Ranges</code>
 objects or both <code>RangesList</code> objects, in which case the
 indices are into the unlisted <code>table</code>. The
 <code>incomparables</code> argument is currently ignored.

 <h3>Notes on Time Complexity</h3>
 
 
 <p>The cost of constructing an instance of the interval tree is a
 <code>O(n*lg(n))</code>, which makes it about as fast as other types of
 overlap query algorithms based on sorting. The good news is that the
 tree need only be built once per subject; this is useful in situations
 of frequent querying. Also, in this implementation the data is stored
 outside of R, avoiding needless copying. Of course, external storage
 is not always convenient, so it is possible to coerce the tree to an
 instance of <code>IRanges</code> (see the Coercion section).
 </p>
 <p>For the query operation, the running time is based on the query size
 <code>m</code> and the average number of hits per query <code>k</code>. The output
 size is then <code>max(mk,m)</code>, but we abbreviate this as
 <code>mk</code>. Note that when the <code>multiple</code> parameter is set to
 <code>FALSE</code>, <code>k</code> is fixed to 1 and drops out of this
 analysis. We also assume here that the query is sorted by start
 position (the <code>findOverlaps</code> function sorts the query if it is unsorted).
 </p>
 <p>An upper bound for finding overlaps is
 <code>O(min(mk*lg(n),n+mk))</code>. The fastest interval tree algorithm
 known is bounded by <code>O(min(m*lg(n),n)+mk)</code> but is a lot more
 complicated and involves two auxillary trees. The lower bound is
 <code>Omega(lg(n)+mk)</code>, which is almost the same as for returning
 the answer, <code>Omega(mk)</code>. The average is of course somewhere in
 between.
 </p>
 <p>This analysis informs the choice of which set of ranges to process
 into a tree, i.e. assigning one to be the subject and the other to be
 the query. Note that if <code>m &gt; n</code>, then the running time is
 <code>O(m)</code>, and the total operation of complexity <code>O(n*lg(n) +
   m)</code> is better than if <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> were exchanged. Thus, for
 once-off operations, it is often most efficient to choose the smaller
 set to become the tree (but <code>k</code> also affects this). This is
 reinforced by the realization that if <code>mk</code> is about the same in
 either direction, the running time depends only on <code>n</code>, which
 should be minimized. Even in cases where a tree has already been
 constructed for one of the sets, it can be more efficient to build a
 new tree when the existing tree of size <code>n</code> is much larger than
 the query set of size <code>m</code>, roughly when <code>n &gt; m*lg(n)</code>.
