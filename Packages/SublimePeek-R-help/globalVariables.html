 <h2>
 Declare Variables to be Treated as Global in Checking a Package
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>The names supplied are of functions or other objects that should be
 regarded as defined globally when the <code>check</code> tool is applied to
 this package.  The call to <code>globalVariables</code> will be included in
 the package's source.  Repeated calls in the same package accumulate
 the names of the global variables.
 </p>
 <p>Typical examples are the fields and methods in reference classes,
 which appear to be global objects to <code>codetools</code>.
 (This case is handled automatically by <code>setRefClass()</code> and
 friends, using the supplied field and method names.)
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 globalVariables(names, package, add = TRUE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>names</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>The character vector of object names.  If omitted, the current list of
 global variables declared in the package will be returned, unchanged.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>The relevant package, usually the character string name of the package
 but optionally its corresponding namespace environment.
 </p>
 <p>When the call to <code>globalVariables</code> comes in the package's source
 file, the argument is normally omitted, as in the example below.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>add</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Should the contents of <code>names</code> be added to the current global
 variables or replace it?
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The list of declared global variables is stored in a metadata object
 in the package's namespace, assuming the <code>globalVariables</code> call(s)
 occur as top-level calls in the package's source code.
 </p>
 <p>The check command, as implemented in package <code>utils</code>, queries the
 global variables list before checking the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> source code in the
 package for possible problems.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>The current list of declared global variables, possibly modified by
 this call.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>The global variables list really belongs to a restricted scope (a
 function or a group of method definitions, for example) rather than the
 package as a whole.  However, implementing finer control would require changes
 in <code>check</code> and/or in <code>codetools</code>, so in this version the
 information is stored at the package level.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 ## Not run: 
 ## assume your package has some code that assigns ".obj1" and ".obj2"
 ## but not in a way that codetools can find.  In the same source file
 ## (to remind you that you did it) add:
 utils::globalVariables(c(".obj1", "obj2"))
 
 ## End(Not run)
 </pre>
