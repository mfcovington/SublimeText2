The <em>keys</em> in this array are the names of object members. It's typical when speaking of an object's members to make a distinction between properties and methods. However, the property/method distinction is little more than a convention. A method is simply a property with a <a title = "en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope">function</a> as its value.</p><p>There are two ways to access object members: dot notation and bracket notation (a.k.a. subscript operator).</p><p><div class = "note"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The ECMAScript specification labels these operators as &quot;property accessors&quot; rather than &quot;member operators&quot;. Given the property/method distinction above, however, we will use &quot;member&quot; as an inclusive term for properties and methods, for the sake of clarity.</div></p></div><div id = "section_2"><span id = "Dot_notation"></span><h2 class = "editable">Dot notation</h2><pre>get = object.property;object.property = set;</pre><p><code>property</code> must be a valid JavaScript identifier, i.e. a sequence of alphanumerical characters, also including the underscore (&quot;<code>_</code>&quot;) and dollar sign (&quot;<code>$</code>&quot;), that cannot start with a number. For example, <code>object.$1</code> is valid, while <code>object.1</code> is not.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>document.createElement('pre');</pre><p>Here, the method named &quot;createElement&quot; is retrieved from <code>document</code> and is called.</p></div><div id = "section_3"><span id = "Bracket_notation"></span><h2 class = "editable">Bracket notation</h2><pre>get = object[property_name];object[property_name] = set;</pre><p><code>property_name</code> is a string. The string does not have to be a valid identifier; it can have any value, e.g. &quot;1foo&quot;, &quot;!bar!&quot;, or even &quot; &quot; (a space).</p><p>Example:</p><pre>document['createElement']('pre');</pre><p>This does the exact same thing as the previous example.</p></div><div id = "section_4"><span id = "Property_names"></span><h2 class = "editable">Property names</h2><p>Property names must be strings. This means that non-string objects cannot be used as keys in the object. Any non-string object, including a number, is typecasted into a string via the <a title = "en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString">toString</a> method.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre>var object = {};object['1'] = 'value';alert(object[1]);</pre><p>This outputs &quot;value&quot;, since 1 is typecasted into '1'.</p><pre>var foo = {unique_prop: 1}, bar = {unique_prop: 2}, object = {};object[foo] = 'value';alert(object[bar]);</pre><p>This also outputs &quot;value&quot;, since both foo and bar are converted to the same string. In the <a title = "en/SpiderMonkey" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a> JavaScript engine, this string would be &quot;[object Object]&quot;.</p></div><div id = "section_5"><span id = "Method_binding"></span><h2 class = "editable">Method binding</h2><p>A method is not bound to the object that it is a method of. Specifically, <code>this</code> is not fixed in a method, i.e. <code>this</code> does not necessarily refer to an object containing the method. <code>this</code> is instead &quot;passed&quot; by the function call.</p><p>See <a title = "en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/this#Method_binding" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/this#Method_binding">method binding</a>.</p></div><div id = "section_6"><span id = "Note_on_eval"></span><h2 class = "editable">Note on <code>eval</code></h2><p>JavaScript novices often make the mistake of using <a title = "en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions/eval" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions/eval" class = "new ">eval</a> where the bracket notation can be used instead. For example, the following syntax is often seen in many scripts.</p><pre>x = eval('document.form_name.' + strFormControl + '.value');</pre><p><code>eval</code> is slow and should be avoided whenever possible. It is better to use the bracket notation instead:</p><pre>x = document.form_name[strFormControl].value;</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></div><!--NOTE--><p class="source-link">This content was sourced by <a href="http://dochub.io/">DocHub</a> from MDN.</p></div></div></body></html>
