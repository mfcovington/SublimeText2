However, in the case of Internet Explorer, when one uses <code>delete</code> on a property, some confusing behavior results, preventing other browsers from using simple objects like object literals as ordered associative arrays. In Explorer, while the property <em>value</em> is indeed set to undefined, if one later adds back a property with the same name, the property will be iterated in its <em>old</em> position--not at the end of the iteration sequence as one might expect after having deleted the property and then added it back.</p><p>So if you want to simulate an ordered associative array in a cross-browser environment, you are forced to either use two separate arrays (one for the keys and the other for the values), or build an array of single-property objects, etc.</p><p></p></div><!--NOTE--><p class="source-link">This content was sourced by <a href="http://dochub.io/">DocHub</a> from MDN.</p></div></div></body></html>
