An object can have a property that is itself another object. See the examples below.</p><p>When the code <code>new <em>foo</em>(...)</code> is executed, the following things happen:</p><ol> <li>A new object is created, inheriting from <code><em>foo</em>.prototype</code>.</li> <li>The constructor function <code><em>foo</em></code> is called with the specified arguments and <code><a title = "this" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/this">this</a></code> bound to the newly created object. <code>new <em>foo</em></code> is equivalent to <code>new <em>foo</em>()</code>, i.e. if no argument list is specified, <code><em>foo</em></code> is called without arguments.</li> <li>The object returned by the constructor function becomes the result of the whole <code>new</code> expression. If the constructor function doesn't explicitly return an object, the object created in step 1 is used instead. (Normally constructors don't return a value, but they can choose to do so if they want to override the normal object creation process.)</li></ol><p>You can always add a property to a previously defined object. For example, the statement <code>car1.color = &quot;black&quot;</code> adds a property color to <code>car1</code>, and assigns it a value of &quot;<code>black</code>&quot;. However, this does not affect any other objects. To add the new property to all objects of the same type, you must add the property to the definition of the <code>car</code> object type.</p><p>You can add a shared property to a previously defined object type by using the <code><a title = "en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/prototype" rel = "internal" href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/prototype">Function.prototype</a></code> property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects created with that function, rather than by just one instance of the object type. The following code adds a color property with value <code>null</code> to all objects of type <code>car</code>, and then overwrites that value with the string &quot;<code>black</code>&quot; only in the instance object <code>car1</code>.
